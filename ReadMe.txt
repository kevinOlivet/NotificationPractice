# NotificationPractice
This project is divided into two ViewControllers using a TabBarController.
In the first tab:
KeyValueObservation is used to monitor a count variable and increment a label.
The variable could be anywhere instead of in the same class.

In the second tab:
Using notifications to pass information with notification.userInfo dictionary.
Instead of just notifying when something has happened information can be passed in dictionary form too.
The count variable is incremente using property observer (didSet)
